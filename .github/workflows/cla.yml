# CLA (Contributor License Agreement) Configuration
# https://github.com/marketplace/actions/cla-assistant-lite
# Official documentation: https://github.com/contributor-assistant/github-action
# Action definition: https://github.com/contributor-assistant/github-action/blob/master/action.yml

# This workflow manages the CLA signing process for contributors.
#
# Key configuration points:
#
# 1. ALLOWLIST (Important!):
#    - Bots and automated services cannot sign CLAs (they're not humans)
#    - The allowlist exempts specific bots from CLA requirements
#    - Without this, every bot commit would fail the CLA check
#    - Current allowlist: pre-commit-ci[bot], dependabot[bot]
#
# 2. CLA DOCUMENT:
#    - Location: https://github.com/astro-transients/tilepy/blob/master/CLA.md
#    - Contributors sign by commenting on their PR
#
# 3. BRANCH:
#    - This project uses 'master' (not 'main')
#    - Signatures are stored in: signatures/version1/cla.json on master branch
#
# 4. WORKFLOW:
#    - When a contributor opens a PR, the bot checks if they've signed the CLA
#    - If not signed, the bot comments with instructions
#    - Contributor signs by commenting: "I have read the CLA Document and I hereby sign the CLA"
#    - Bots in the allowlist bypass this check entirely
