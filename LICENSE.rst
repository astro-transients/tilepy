Preamble
========

The GNU Lesser General Public License is a free, copyleft license for software 
and other kinds of works, specifically designed to allow linking with 
proprietary software under certain conditions.  

The licenses for most software and other practical works are designed to take 
away your freedom to share and change the works. By contrast, the GNU Lesser 
General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change 
all versions of a programâ€”ensuring it remains free software for all its users.

When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not price.  
Our General Public Licenses are designed to ensure you have the freedom to 
distribute copies of free software, receive source code, modify it, and know you 
can do these things.

The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and modification follow.
