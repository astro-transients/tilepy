# Pre-commit configuration for code quality and style enforcement.
# This setup uses multiple hooks to check for common issues (merge conflicts, invalid JSON/TOML/YAML/XML, symlinks, trailing whitespace, etc.),
# and ensures consistent formatting and linting for Python code using Ruff.
# For more information about pre-commit hooks, see: https://pre-commit.com
