Scheduling and Tiling Tools (`tilepy.include`)
==============================================

The `tilepy.include` package provides core modules for scheduling, tiling computation, and visualization
in the |TilePy| workflow. It enables rapid follow-up observations, campaign configuration, and plotting for
multi-messenger astronomy.

Observation Schedule
====================

The **ObservationScheduler** module offers algorithms and utilities to schedule rapid follow-up observations
of electromagnetic counterparts to gravitational wave transients. It computes optimal tiling schedules for telescopes,
generates visibility plots, and supports both single- and multi-observatory coordination.
