abstract = {Time-domain astrophysics has leaped forward with the direct discovery of gravitational waves and the emergence of new generation instruments for multimessenger studies. The capacity of the multimessenger multiwavelength community to effectively pursue follow-up observations is hindered by the suboptimal localization of numerous transient events and the escalating volume of alerts. Thus, we have developed an effective tool to overcome the observational and technical hurdles inherent in the emerging field of multimessenger astrophysics. We present tilepy, a Python package for the automatic scheduling of follow-up observations of poorly localized transient events. It is ideally suited to tackle the challenge of complex follow-up in mid- and small-field-of-view telescope campaigns, with or without human intervention. We demonstrate the capabilities of tilepy in the realm of multiobservatory, multiwavelength campaigns, to cover the localization uncertainty region of various events ultimately aiming at pinpointing the source of the multimessenger emission. The tilepy code is publicly available on GitHub and is sufficiently flexible to be employed either automatically or in a customized manner, tailored to collaboration and individual requirements. tilepy is also accessible via a public API and through the Astro-COLIBRI platform.}
